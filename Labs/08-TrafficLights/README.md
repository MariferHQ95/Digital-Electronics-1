# Lab 8: Traffic light controller## ObjectivesIn this laboratory exercise you will implement a finite state machine, specifically a traffic light controller at a junction. You will use the Xilinx Isim simulator or the EDA playground online tool. You will use a push button on the CoolRunner board as reset device, onboard clock signal with frequency of 10 kHz for synchronization, and CPLD expansion board LEDs as outputs.## Image of Schematic![Image of Schematic](https://github.com/MariferHQ95/Digital-Electronics-1/blob/master/Images/PureTRaffic.png)
